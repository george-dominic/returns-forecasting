## Pre-requisites
- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: python.org.

Conda is an alternative package manager that is often used for managing Python environments. You can install conda by downloading Anaconda or Miniconda from their respective websites.

- **Virtual Environment (optional)**: It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for your Python project. Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. You can create a virtual environment using tools like venv, virtualenv, or conda.
